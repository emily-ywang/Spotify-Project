# Spotify-Project

Utilizing Pandas and Seaborn in Python in order to summarize and visualize musical charecteristics provided by Spotify. From the point of view of an musician or artist, Spotify's classification system for songs may appear daunting or seemingly random. Through our analysis, we hoped to demistify the attributes Spotify placed on songs, visualize summary statistics regarding the relationship between these attributes, prepare a tool for artists to understand charcteristics of their songs firsthand, and help artists to optimize the popularity of their songs.
