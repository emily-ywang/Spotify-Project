# Spotify-Project
Members: Emily Wang and Marco Tortolani

Utilizing pandas and seaborn in python in order to sumarize and visualize musical charecteristics provided by spotify. From the point of view of an musician or artist, spotify's classification system for songs may appear daunting or seemingly random. Through our analysis, we hoped to demistify the attributes spotify placed on songs, visualize summary statistics about the relationship between these attributes, and prepare a tool for artists to understandcteristics of their songs firsthand.
